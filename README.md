# ECanada_Stickleback
data to accompany paper: "Intraspecific diversity of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) populations in eastern Canada"

2 .csv files are included: 
"EastCoast_stickleback-data.csv" is used for plate frequency plot
"EastCoast_stickleback-data-reduced.csv" is used for maps.

These data sheets are very similar, but in the reduced dataset, the
rivers/streams with multiple sites have been reduced to a single location
to reduce clutter on the maps.

In many instances, geographic coordinates were not provided in the original papers, 
or were provided with insufficient resolution, so the coordinates included were often based 
on descriptions or place names and may not be 100% accurate. Consult original references.
